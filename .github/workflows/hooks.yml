# GitHub Actions Workflow Documentation
#
# Purpose:
#   Automates the execution of pre-commit hooks on every push to any branch
#   in the repository to ensure code quality and consistency.
#
# Workflow Name: Git hooks
#
# Trigger:
#   - Event: push
#   - Branches: All branches (wildcard "*")
#
# Permissions:
#   - contents: read - Access to repository contents
#   - issues: read - Access to repository issues
#   - pull-requests: read - Access to pull requests
#
# Environment Variables:
#   - environment: Set to "base" - defines the deployment environment
#   - timezone: Retrieved from repository variable TIMEZONE
#
# Jobs:
#
#   1. setup (Infrastructure 🔧):
#      Description: Prepares the workflow environment and validates configuration
#      Runs on: ubuntu-latest
#      Outputs:
#        - environment: The environment name for downstream jobs
#        - timezone: The timezone setting for the workflow
#      Steps:
#        - Echoes the configured environment name
#        - Echoes the configured timezone setting
#
#   2. hooks (Hooks 🪝):
#      Description: Executes pre-commit hooks against all files in the repository
#      Dependencies: Requires successful completion of 'setup' job
#      Runs on: ubuntu-latest
#      Environment: Uses environment output from setup job
#      Steps:
#        - Checks out the repository code
#        - Sets up Python using version specified in VARS.PYTHON_VERSION
#        - Installs pre-commit package via pip
#        - Runs all pre-commit hooks against all files in the repository
