# GitHub Actions Workflow Documentation
#
# Name: Build
# Purpose: Executes Docker build process on pull requests to validate the devsecops-hooks container
#
# Trigger:
#   - pull_request: Runs on all branches when a pull request is created or updated
#
# Permissions:
#   - Workflow level: None (empty permissions object)
#   - Build job level: read access to contents and pull-requests
#
# Environment Variables:
#   - environment: Set to "base" - defines the deployment environment
#   - timezone: Retrieved from repository variable TIMEZONE
#
# Jobs:
#   1. setup (Infrastructure 🔧):
#      - Runs on: ubuntu-latest
#      - Purpose: Initializes and validates environment configuration
#      - Outputs: 
#        * environment: Passes environment name to dependent jobs
#        * timezone: Passes timezone setting to dependent jobs
#      - Steps:
#        * Displays configured environment name
#        * Displays configured timezone
#
#   2. build (Build ⚒️):
#      - Runs on: ubuntu-latest
#      - Dependencies: Requires successful completion of setup job
#      - Environment: Uses environment name from setup job output
#      - Steps:
#        * Checks out repository code using actions/checkout@v6.0.1 (pinned SHA)
#        * Builds Docker image with tag "devsecops-hooks:local"
#        * Executes the built container with current directory mounted to /src
#
# Security Considerations:
#   - Uses pinned commit SHA for checkout action to ensure immutability
#   - Minimal permissions granted (read-only access where needed)
#   - No secrets or credentials exposed in workflow
#
