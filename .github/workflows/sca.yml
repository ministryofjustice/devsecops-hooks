# Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Workflow
#
# This workflow performs security scanning of software dependencies and components.
# It runs on multiple triggers to ensure comprehensive coverage of dependency security.
#
# Triggers:
#   - schedule: Daily at midnight UTC (cron: "0 0 * * *")
#   - pull_request: When PRs are opened/updated targeting the main branch
#   - push: When code is pushed to the main branch
#   - workflow_dispatch: Manual trigger via GitHub UI
#   - branch_protection_rule: When branch protection rules are modified
#
# Permissions:
#   - contents: write - Required to access repository contents and create commits
#   - pull-requests: write - Required to comment on PRs with scan results
#   - issues: write - Required to create/update security issues
#   - security-events: write - Required to upload security scan results to GitHub Security
#   - id-token: write - Required for OIDC authentication
#   - actions: read - Required to read workflow run information
#
# Steps:
#   1. Repository: Checks out the repository code
#   2. Node: Sets up Node.js environment using the version from repository variables
#   3. Install: Installs npm dependencies without running scripts for security
#   4. SCA: Executes the Software Composition Analysis using MoJ's DevSecOps action
#      - Uses GitHub token for authentication
#      - References custom dependency review configuration
#      - Scans Docker images listed in sources.json
#
# Dependencies:
#   - actions/checkout@v6.0.1
#   - actions/setup-node@v6.1.0
#   - ministryofjustice/devsecops-actions/sca@v1.2.0
#
# Configuration Files:
#   - .github/dependency-review-config.yml: Custom dependency review rules
#   - sources.json: List of Docker images to scan
