# Dependencies Review Workflow
#
# Description:
#   Automated workflow to evaluate and review dependencies in the repository using Renovate.
#   Runs on a scheduled basis and can be manually triggered.
#
# Triggers:
#   - schedule: Executes every minute (cron: "* * * * *")
#   - workflow_dispatch: Manual trigger available
#
# Permissions:
#   - Global: None (empty permissions object)
#   - Dependencies job: read contents, write pull-requests
#
# Environment Variables:
#   - environment: Set to 'base' (default environment)
#   - timezone: Retrieved from repository variable TIMEZONE
#
# Jobs:
#   1. setup:
#      - Purpose: Establishes infrastructure and environment configuration
#      - Runner: ubuntu-latest
#      - Outputs: environment name and timezone for downstream jobs
#      - Steps: Echoes environment and timezone settings
#
#   2. dependencies:
#      - Purpose: Performs dependency review using Renovate
#      - Runner: ubuntu-latest
#      - Depends on: setup job
#      - Steps:
#        a. Checks out repository code (actions/checkout@v6.0.1)
#        b. Runs Renovate CLI with repository-specific configuration
#      - Requires: GITHUB_TOKEN secret for authentication
#      - Configuration: Requires Renovate config file to be present
#
# Security Considerations:
#   - Uses pinned action versions with commit SHA for supply chain security
#   - Minimal permissions granted (principle of least privilege)
#   - Requires explicit Renovate configuration file
#
# Notes:
#   - Consider adjusting cron schedule ("* * * * *") as it runs every minute
#   - Renovate requires a configuration file in the repository
#   - TIMEZONE variable should be defined in repository variables
