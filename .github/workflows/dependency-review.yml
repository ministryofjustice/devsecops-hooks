# GitHub Actions workflow for automated dependency review on pull requests
#
# Purpose:
#   Analyzes dependencies in pull requests targeting the main branch to identify
#   potential security vulnerabilities, license issues, and supply chain risks
#
# Triggers:
#   - Pull requests targeting the 'main' branch
#
# Workflow Jobs:
#   1. setup: Configures infrastructure and environment variables
#      - Outputs environment name and timezone for downstream jobs
#      - Runs on ubuntu-latest
#
#   2. dependencies: Performs dependency analysis
#      - Requires 'contents: read' and 'pull-requests: write' permissions
#      - Uses GitHub's dependency-review-action to scan dependency changes
#      - Posts review summary as a comment on the pull request
#      - Depends on successful completion of setup job
#
# Environment Variables:
#   - environment: Set to 'base' deployment environment
#   - timezone: Retrieved from repository variable TIMEZONE
#
# Security:
#   - Workflow runs with minimal permissions (permissions: {})
#   - Individual jobs request only necessary permissions
#   - Uses pinned action versions with SHA commits for security
#
# Dependencies:
#   - actions/checkout@v6.0.1 (SHA: 8e8c483db84b4bee98b60c0593521ed34d9990e8)
#   - actions/dependency-review-action@v4.8.3 (SHA: 774d14bf50b7a2e2460f9f49e25c52503ecab125)
